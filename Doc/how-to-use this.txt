Target :

in your office when ever you get new project for automation and you decide to run via Maven-junit,
-> you can clone this project,
-> change only project pages & tests.
-> Use exsisting test organization

Bonus,
1. via maven you can run in any CI
2. via shell script , you can have webdriver grid setup.



Allure intregration :

Allure report framework , junit port added , you can use this for test NG also, just change in POM.XML

Allure does not keep history, shows only current. So, if you are testing via CI, you need to keep history seperately in different workspace.

If you run locally, just Use jetty pliguns(may change tha port of jettey)
Allure is Angular Java APP, so any Java app server can run this. So , if you have multiple host testing, you can intregrate them together (webdriver hib/node)


--- Need to dicuess--
can we make only acceptace runnable via cucumber or serenity
And, make a seperate project which will take this as dependent project.
 BAs/Managers/Developers will run acceptance before code commit, merge, branch, release,
