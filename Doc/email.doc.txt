This is a fake email server , main project => https://sourceforge.net/projects/fakemail/
Download and run (it is present in resources)
I run with no specific settings (my free port was 9500)

python fakemail.py --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9500

We can define log/email folder like this =>

python /home/shantonu/fakemail/fakemail.py --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9500 --path=/home/shantonu/fakemail/mail --log=/home/shantonu/fakemail/log --background


So, after running, if you try to send email, you will recieve all email as file where all recipient names will be the file name


this is one of email recipent
