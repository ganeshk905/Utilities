In this section I will try to simplyfy Maven in easy way

Maven is a Full Develpment life cycle management system. That means it has

validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
compile - compile the source code of the project
test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

clean - handles project cleaning,
site - handles the creation of your project's site documentation.


Maven Plugins :

We use this following plugins :

Our Project maven commands:
Compile :

Run tests :

Making result site :

Running the results locally :


Multiple maven project :


Dependency Management + Plugin Mangement => Bothe are different from depencencises and plugins.
 Diff : 1. Parent maintain versions, so no need to put version info in child
 2. you need to specify which dependency/plugin will go in which child. (without management , child get all item from plugins)


 Profile :
 Profile can be used for
 1. Different repository
 2. different module
 3. different build sequence and definations
 4. different dependency set
